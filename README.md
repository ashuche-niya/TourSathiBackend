# TourSathiBackend
This repository contains the backend of tourSathi android app. Its written in Javascript and makes use of nodeJS and ExpressJS. Description of app is as follows:
An android app that makes your travelling (in group) comfortable and much easier to manage.
Here in this android app we have tried to solve the some of the major issues which are faced during travelling especially in group.

1.) Track of each other's location
This feature shows the location of each member of the group on the map which can be seen by all members of the group.Unlike other apps, this information is shown in the same map and gets updated in real time. This helps in better coordination within the group while travelling.

2.) Share photos with each other – Along with the above feature one can also upload and download the photos from the common library provided in the app. This helps in better organization of media of all the trips.

3.) Chat with each other – We added this as a mandatory feature which connects the people in the group. All the members are kept in same chat-room.

4.) Split the balances -  Although there are apps which performs splitting of expenses during travelling but we thought of collaborating that feature into this to make user experience much better and thus this feature makes this app an adequate app to be used by travellers.
